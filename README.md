# acoustic-distance-measurement

This project is an acoustic distance measurement system using various functionalities of the Nexys A7-100T FPGA board. The most common method for measurement of distance is the time of arrival method. In this project, we explore
the implementation of this method using the phase shift conversion for calculation of distances between 1-10 feet.

The Schematic of the system for this project was built on Vivado, and the coding and interface to board were done on Xilinx using Embedded C.
